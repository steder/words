I'm awful at Words with Friends and less awful at programming so here's an attempt to 'solve' Words with Friends type
problems using Python.

====================
What is this?
====================

  * A words with Friends dictionary including points per letter.
  * Python class suitable for interactive use while playing a game of Words with Friends or Scrabble.  Includes:
    - method to find words beginning with a given prefix
    - method to find words ending with a given suffix
    - method to find anagrams given a set of letters (including wildcards)

=====================
TODO
=====================

Currently I haven't tried to track and solve an entire WWFs board although that is clearly the next step.

Better queries like:
 * "find me all words I could spell with hand 'ielrenn' that are prefixed with q, t, a, or l"
 * "find all words I can spell with hand 'ielrenn' that *contain* r"
 * "find all words that I can spell with 'ielrenn' that are suffixed with  '*'"

I'm also looking into exposing a simple a web interface so that I can share any advantages with my opponents.
